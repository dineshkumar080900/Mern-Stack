    According to the UNESCO, Srirangam is considered the biggest functioning Hindu temple in the world,[2] as it covers an area of about 631,000 square metres (6,790,000 sq ft) with a perimeter of 4 km (10,710 ft),[3] Angkor Wat which is also dedicated to Vishnu is even bigger but services do not take place any more in the temple. Srirangam is one of a few self-manifested shrines (Svayam Vyakta Kshetras) of Vishnu. The temple complex spans 156 acres (0.63 km2). It has seven prakaras (enclosures). These enclosures are formed by tall, thick rampart walls running around the sanctum. There are 21 towers, gopurams, in all prakaras decreasing in height inwards. The temple town lies on an islet formed by the rivers Kaveri and Kollidam.[4]The southern gopuram of the temple, called the Rajagopuram, is 239.5 feet tall and, as of 2016, is the tallest in Asia. The construction of the Rajagopuram began during the reign of Achyuta Deva Raya of the Vijayanagara empire. However, construction was halted after his death and the structure of the Rajagopuram remained incomplete for over 400 years. The completion of the Rajagopuram was undertaken and completed successfully by Sri Vedanta Desika Yatheendra Mahadesikan, the 44th jeeyar of Sri Ahobila Matha. The construction spanned 8 years before it was consecrated on 25 March 1987.
